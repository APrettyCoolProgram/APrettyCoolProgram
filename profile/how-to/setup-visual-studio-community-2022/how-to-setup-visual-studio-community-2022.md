# How to setup Visual Studio 2022

This document will walk through the steps I use to setup the Visual Studio 2022 (version 17.12.3)

## Initial installation

### Workflows

The following workflows will be installed:

* ASP.NET and web development
* Azure Development
* .NET Multi-platform APP UI development
* .NET desktop development

The installation workload screen should look like this: [1](./_attachments/installation-workloads-01.png) | [2](./_attachments/installation-workloads-02.png)

### Individual components

The installed workflows will take care of which individual components are installed.

Install whichever language(s) you need.
